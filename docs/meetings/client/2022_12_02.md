## Team A

- Quick overview of the week:
  - we have great feedback from our peer testing sessions so we have some stuff to improve

- our goals for next semester will be animating the face and body, along with improved realism
- our question about making the program a package or something instead of API
  - Erik: whatever works for us, as long as it can integrate with their system
  - Logan: sending over HTTP, it might be slower with the audio and text files, so to avoid additional time sending...
  - will stick with original plan of API
- determine when we'll message them in January to determine the new meeting schedule

## Team B

- this week, they were working on their animator request flushed out
- will send the word document outlining what frames are needed (mouths and poses), animator notes today
- 22 different mouths, many may overlap with other teams
- same characters, or easy colour changes
- API is almost done, needs to be uploaded

## Team C

- does Kukarella have a virtual private server to test on?
  - Erik: maybe? ask Group B what they did or try a cloud service for free trial, or just have local API working. It
would be more difficult to add us to theirs, and it's not necessary for them to host it until they receive our stuff.
- The API for the demo API on the front page, is that fine for us to use?
  - Erik: the demo is fine to use, they charge ~10-15 for 1 million characters
- The free API demo... we can make 20-30 calls within a couple minutes - just wanted to check on blocks
  - Erik: thank you for pointing that out, it was made a while ago so we'll check it out

## To-do List

- Animator may need feedback over the break, so please have at least 1 person per team available on Discord to check
every couple days just in case
- Determine scheduling for next semester for the client meeting
