## Team B

- Demo video of a character with lips syncing
  - Body poses as well
  - Eyebrows
  - Eyes
  - 30 frames per second
  - Looks like it was created from the open-source code from the YouTube video that was provided in the project
description at the beginning of the project – GMA? ("Gee-maw") - has models provided for demo purposes
  - Problem: it doesn’t support other languages, other than English
  - Uses Gentle – some words aren’t a part of the dictionary and so mispronunciation cannot be fixed
- Next steps
  - Animator Request
  - Cleaning up the animation
    - E.g., double fixing
  - Fixing undetectable words in the Gentle dictionary

## Team C

- Showing their phoneme mappings process time: 1.72 words per second when mapping the phonemes from provided text
- Next steps
  - Integrating and optimizing Gentle
  - Generating video

## Team A

- Demo available as well
  - Mouth only
  - Available in both English and non-English languages
  - No body poses
- Next steps
  - Animation process only started
  - Flushing it out and integrating the process into the package
  - Following up on the asset requests that were sent at the beginning of November, but Nazim missed the message as
  he was not tagged

## Questions

- Team B requested an API endpoint from Erik that we could call
  - He could, but it’s easier if we make ours as the API that takes the audio in
- How much exception handling? Kukarella already does a lot on their end, so if we want to implement anything on our end
(not totally necessary), then we can but we can also turn it off so we reduce processing time

## Closing Remarks

- By the end of next week, we are submitting a prototype video
- Nazim was very happy to see visible progress
  - Impressed with Team B's animation video
  - Happy about Group A having English and non-English

## To-do List

1. If requesting anything from Nazim, please make sure to tag him in Discord messages so that he doesn't miss anything
2. Ensure requests for the artist are in ASAP as they will be discussing it with the artist on Monday, Nov. 21
