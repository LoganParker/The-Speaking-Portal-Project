## Team A

- Milestones
  - Erik mentioned that it's fine to work on the program first and the API integration later
- Group Needs from Client
  - went over the list of group needs
  - shared the link with the client
  - Erik will be converting the accounts to premium accounts and confirmed he found Team A's account
- Repository (public or private?)
  - Erik said we can keep it public. If we need to share it or if they want to check it, then we can just provide the
  developer with the link directly

## Team B

- Team B's milestones are very similar to Team A's, so they don't have any additional questions
- Erik could not find the email provided for the Kukarella account

## Team C

- Team C will be interfacing with Kukarella early (different from Teams A and B), so they asked about documentation
- Erik could not find the email provided for the Kukarella account

## Client Comments

- Nazim is concerned that what we need from the artist will take a long time, so we need to provide them with the
list of required animations and assets from the artist as soon as possible
- Erik will provide his email in the Discord channel so that we can contact him directly if we have any questions

## To-do List

1. **List of required animations from the artist.** Veronica started the list of needs from the artist in the [Group Needs from Client Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1genxo76LzcmimXTYXSz_HTtw0Nbq2PrhihhkHF2NKRo/edit)
2. **Reschedule next week's meeting** because Erik won't be available on Oct. 28
