## 🃏 Joke of the Day

What do you call 8 hobbits? A hobbyte

## 📢 Announcements

- Week 3 GitStats due this week on Friday
- Week 4 has a new deliverable we should ask the prof about
- Rhubarb developer replied! Check Discord for a screenshot of the message

## 📅 Last Week (Restrospective)

- Thank you, Matt, for submitting GitStats for us!
- Ed was working on making a formal API definition, but it's incomplete
- We found that Postman was crashing (screen goes white when trying to preview, but the download works)
- Veronica implemented blinking, but could implement types to improve it for TypeScript

## 📋 This Week

### Assets

- Official assets with mouths and eyes are exported from Photoshop! Thank you, Logan!
- If we want to have the arms move...
  - Need to check with Client if we want breathing vs. poses because poses will require more from the artist
  - Barb's arms are movable
  - The boy's arms are attached to the body, which are attached to the feet and are NOT movable

### Issues this week

- Continue working on a formal API definition (Ed)
- Figure out why Postman is crashing (Ed & Matt)
  - This could have to do with ffmpeg scaling (Logan)
  - Matt had it temporarily working after a re-install, but it's broken again
- Implement more types and clean up current types (Veronica & Ed)
- Rhubarb developer to-do's:
  - Extended mouth shapes being used? double check (Veronica)
  - Check command-line program's exit code rather than its output (Matt & Veronica)
- Check Boy in Illustrator because his arms might not be movable due to flattening of layers (Veronica)
- Need to find better test files with harder English words so that we can better showcase what we have (Everyone)

## 🔮 Future Issues (after this week)

- Export the assets in different arm positions after discussing at client meeting
- If doing poses, will we trigger them randomly? How do we want to do this? Something to think about this week.

## 🤝 Client Meeting

- Showcase videos from both recognizers so that we can ask if they want quality vs. speed for English
- We should also ask if they want breathing or specific poses (which would require more from the artist)
- need to check Boy in Illustrator, as we might need to request asset change

## 📝 Additional Notes

- Veronica and Ed switched responsibilities for note-taking due to scheduling
  - V will take team minutes
  - Ed will take client minutes
