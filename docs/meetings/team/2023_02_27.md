## 📅 Last 2 Weeks (Restrospective)

- We're nearing the end which feels good, and we feel good about our progress
- Veronica updated the usability tasks, but we should go over it together as a group!

## 📋 This Week

### Assets

- Current temporary poses
  - Will need to reach out to client so that we can receive official poses from artist
  - Once recieved, we'll need to export the assets for our file setup
- Will we want transition poses or something for the transition to a new pose? In the YouTube demo, the stick figure
bounced a bit when it went into a new pose.
  - Due to the timings of our frames, implementing the transitions may prove difficult or look strange
  - Let's see if it's mentioned in peer testing

### Issues this week

- We want to figure out why the servers are performing worse than our local machines (Matt)
  - Need to investigate if our API is opening threads appropriately
- Update Usability Task List (Veronica)
  - repeat scenarios only if there's time
  - test with server rather than local machine
  - update instructions for peer testing to fill out Google Form at the same time
- Google Form for feedback (Team)
  - keep track of parameters for each scenario
  - list of questions for feedback
- Review current documentation to ensure it's accurate and updated, then convert to GitHub Pages
  - Currently, we have our README, separate API documentation, and separate tooling documentation
- Video demo: let's screen record and voice over again.
  - It's a busy week, so it might only be done with a couple group members instead of everyone

## 🤝 Client Meeting

- Show off poses and high-resolution
- Check on the asset pose request
- Performance report: Show our results in a table for audio files of different lengths (10s, 30s, 1:00, 1:30, etc.)
