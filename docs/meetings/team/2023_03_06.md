## 📅 Last Week (Restrospective)

- We had small gitstats, but we're okay with that and we all had a busy week.
- Ed started working on the performance report by outlining the test cases of what we want to show

## 📋 This Week

### Assets

- Current temporary poses
  - Will need to reach out to client so that we can receive official poses from artist
  - Once recieved, we'll need to export the assets for our file setup

### Issues this week

- Ed will continue with the performance report with Matt's help
- We also want to figure out why the servers are performing worse than our local machines and want to investigate if our API is opening threads appropriately
- Review current documentation to ensure it's accurate and updated, then convert to GitHub Pages?
  - Currently, we have our README, separate API documentation, and separate tooling documentation

## 🤝 Client Meeting
