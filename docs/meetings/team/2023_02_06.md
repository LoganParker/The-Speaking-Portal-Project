***Attendence Comments***

- Logan is back this week!

## 🃏 Joke of the Day

Why couldn't the bicycle stand by itself? It was too tired.

## 📢 Announcements

- Week 19 GitStats due this week on Friday
- TA will view a demo on February 15
- Rhubarb developer replied again. Looks like the hack won't work for us and our long text files :(

## 📅 Last Week (Restrospective)

- We sent the client our pose requests for the artist and asked for each position to be sent instead of as a batch
- Matt made a report last week based on Jmeter tests (6 requests) and system monitoring tools to show the difference
in performance for cores/threads
  - our requests are received in parallel
  - but we we don't know if our requests are being processed in parallel
  - single core shows it's processing sequentially
  - two-core works better than the four-core
  - Ideas as to why:
    - diminishing returns when more cores added due to memory reservation
    - did we not set it up properly/efficiently?
    - it might need to be sequential?
  - When Ed runs it on his system, the 4-core seems to run in parallel
- Ed got the unit tests working!
- V implemented pose changes, types, enums, but more work to do
- V changed the mouth asset for the :o face

## 📋 This Week

### Assets

- Before we receive the art, for the demo, we will need a temporary solution (text box?)
- The photoshop file might be corrupted? V will export it again for Logan to examine
- Once we receive the pose files, we'll need to export the assets for our file setup

### Issues this week

- Efficiency:
  - We need to find out if 2-core is more efficient on ALL machines
  - Will redo the test with another timer to understand it a bit more
  - It would be nice to test it on a more powerful machine (free trial for server?)
  - Ask other groups this week to find out how they're responding to multiple parallel requests
- If Matt has time, will help with types
- Ed will continue working on unit tests because we don't have full coverage and will help with the efficiency
- Veronica will continue working on the logic behind the pose changes and types
- Logan will work on the photoshop script for the internal tool for when the assets come in
- Logan will review code to catch up and clean up
- Implement a timer for each process and add in our `console.log()` and maybe even in our own log file
- Make our own log file and include timings and other info (errors?)
- Check on how we're handling our errors

## 🤝 Client Meeting

- Check on the pose request from artist

## 📝 Additional Notes

- In 2-3 weeks (or after reading week), we can ask the client dev about testing in their server environment for
performance and efficiency
