## 📢 Announcements

- Week 18 GitStats due this week on Friday
- there was a new deliverable, but it's no longer on Canvas
- Rhubarb developer replied again! Check Discord for a screenshot of the message

## 📅 Last Week (Restrospective)

- Ed built out tests for the animation factory that run well locally, but when they run in GitHub actions, they fail.
- Last week went well, no comment
- Matt was looking into C++ to implement the Rhubarb hack

## 📋 This Week

### Assets

- We will need to make a request to the artist for different positions
  - Nazim asked that we be as specific as possible
  - Ideas for body language
    1) hand on hip, other hand down
    2) one hand up to explain
    3) two hands up to explain
- Once we receive the art, we'll need to export the assets for our file setup

### Issues this week

- Find a paper about body language and speaking positions so that we have a good set of positions to request
- Veronica will reply to the Rhubarb developer (1 is true, 2 is usually false)
- Ed's attempting fix a bug for testing the animation factory, but might do it differently if the fix doesn't work
- For idle animation, Logan thinks he might have a programming solution, in progress on `ffmpeg-overhaul`
- Let's put a pause on implementing types because Logan's work is not guaranteed to work yet
  - If we're going to add types, we will need to draw out a data diagram to map out the structure
- V can implement the logic behind the idle animation and poses
- Matt will work on our API's requests to ensure it can deal with multiple requests
- Let's clean up the issues on GitHub
- For the Postman issue, can use the Google Chrome extension in the meantime. If using the desktop client, can only send and download.

## 🤝 Client Meeting

- We will need to send the request for poses this week

## 📝 Additional Notes

- We will be doing a demo for the TA on February 15 with all our features (lip-sync, multiple languages, poses, realism)
