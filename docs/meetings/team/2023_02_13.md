## 🃏 Joke of the Day

Did you know crocodiles can grow up to 16 feet? I still don’t believe it though. I’ve only seen ones with 4.

## 📢 Announcements

- Week 20 GitStats due this week on Friday
- TA will view our demo this Wednesday, February 15th
- Reading week is next week, so no Gitstats!

## 📅 Last Week (Restrospective)

- We sent the client our pose requests for the artist and asked for each position to be sent individually instead of as
a batch, but we haven't heard back about it yet
- Ed got another unit test in last week!
- We unfortunately can't run a Git Runner on Rhubarb beacuse it's not on the repo. Do we want to ignore these tests?
Matt & Logan say there should be a solution (e.g., installing a release via command line)
- Matt got a server image up so our API can run on good hardware instead of locally on our laptops!
- Logan got the script working for Adobe Illustrator so that managing assets is A LOT easier!

## 📋 This Week

### Assets

- We currently have temporary poses implemented until we receive the real poses from the artist
- Once we receive the pose files, we'll need to export the assets for our file setup.
- Will we want transition poses or something for the transition to a new pose? In the YouTube demo, the stick figure
bounced a bit when it went into a new pose.
  - Group consensus: Peer evaluations can help us determine what we should do.

### Issues this week

- Demo this Wednesday; let's run the API on the server image with the good hardware!
- Matt to follow up with Nazim about the assets
- See if we can get Rhubarb to run with Git Runner
- Add directory checker to make sure Rhubarb and ffmpeg are installed so that the API doesn't listen for requests if
the program isn't ready
- Have node app persist after ssh session is closed
- Update the timer so that it's only around the functions that we're most concerned about
- Timer can be implemented in test env?
- Update README, update Usability Tasks

## 🤝 Client Meeting

- Reach out to other liaisons to see if we need to meet this week
- Check on the asset pose request
- Inform client that next week is reading week
- Once we have quantitative data, we can approach the client about performance vs. efficiency

## 📝 Additional Notes

- In a couple weeks (after reading week), we can ask the client dev about testing in their server environment for
performance and efficiency.
