## 📋 This Week

### Peer Testing Report Breakdown

- (10%) Brief description of your system and its current set of features available in the testing session

- (10%) Identify the number of participants that completed your study. In particular, include a table of participant's names, status (completed, partially completed, no show, type of evaluation (user vs. think aloud)). For incomplete and no show statuses, provide an explanation. Indicate who ran each session and who the participant was. (only for those that run the sessions remote) Links to all the videos that were recorded.

- (15%) The user group and associated list of tasks (use cases) you asked your participants to complete

- (20%) List of issues discovered, prioritized and presented in order of high, medium, then low.

- (20%) Average the quantitative scores you received from the participants in a bar graph with the 5 points on the y-axis and the 10 heuristics on the x-axis. Label your axes. Indicate the number of data points used in the graph. Be sure to explain the graph using the issues identified and any quoted comments you obtained from the participants. I'm expect an explanation for each one of the scores (i.e., why the team believe they got that score, how to improve it, whether or not it's important for their project, ...)
