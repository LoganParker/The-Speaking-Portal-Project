# Recognizer Reasearch!

## Notes
Subjects engaged in blind test trial with two charactars and were asked for their feedback. 

## Subject 1 

### Animation feedback
Subject noted that english recognizer looked better, when asked to grade quality amount on a scale of 1-5 subject stated quality difference was marginal, giving a score of 1. Subject would pick phonetic, with their rationel better load times. 

### Character design feedback 
Subject stated preference for kevin design over amber design. Criticms of Amber design: neck and fingers were too long. Subject stated legs also looked strange, but this may just be due to charactar nuetral pose. Subject cited eyes and facial roundness in boy design as positive traits. 

### Closing thoughts
Subject was bewildered to have engaged in study. Perhaps more of an introduction is in order, instead of vaguely telling a subject they are participating in active science. 

## Subject 2

### Animation feedback
Subject noted that english recognizer looked better, when asked to grade quality amount on a scale of 1-5 subject stated quality difference was small, giving a score of 2. Subject would prefer quality over processing time

### Character design feedback 
Subject stated preference for Kevin design over Amber design. Subject stated the glass tint on Amber design and long fingers as undesirable qualities. Subject made comments about lack of breasts from design, which was rather innapropriate. Subject remarked Kevin design looked better, citing roundness of face and eyes. 

### Closing thoughts
Maybe I should pick better subjects in the future. 

## Subject 3

### Animation feedback
Subject stated english recognizer as better. When asked to grad quality amount on a scale of 1-5 subject stated quality difference was small, giving a score of 2. Prefered animation quality over processing time. 

### Character design feedback 
Subject did not like hands and legs on Amber design. Very fond of round face and overall design of Kevin. 

### Closing thoughts
Subject expressed an immense fondness for Kevin model. Subject maybe has a thing for gingers? 

## Subject 4 

### Animation feedback
Subject stated phonetic recognizer as better. When asked to grad quality amount on a scale of 1-5 subject stated quality difference was small, giving a score of 3. 
Felt quality was better. 

### Character design feedback 
Subject did not like Amber's hands or glasses. Participant noted that Amber's design felt lanky and weird. Said Kevin looked better and was more 'cartoony'. 

### Closing thoughts
Subject was rather snippy and impatient. I guess not all people are ecstatic to advance science.
