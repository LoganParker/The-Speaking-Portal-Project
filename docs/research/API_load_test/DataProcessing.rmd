## R Markdown

## Data Log 1



## Performance Log

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}
files = c("singlecoretest.csv", "duocoretest.csv", "duocoretest2.csv", "quadcoretest.csv")
perflog = paste("perflogs/",files,sep="")
jmeterlog = paste("jlogs/",files,sep="")



```

```{r}

library(anytime)
install


logread = function(filename){ 
data = data.frame(read.csv(filename))

typeof(data)

data[,1] = anytime(data[,1]/1000)
data[,2] = (data[,2]/(60000))
return(data)
}


jmeterlog = sapply(jmeterlog, function(x) logread(x))

jmeterlog[,3]
```


```{r , echo=FALSE}
library(anytime)
generatePerfGraph = function(filename){
log = as.data.frame(read.csv(filename))
colnames(log) = c("time","memory","cpu0","cpu1","cpu2","cpu3","cpu4","cpu5","cpu6","cpu7","cpuTotal")
time = utctime(log[,1])

colors = c("red","orange","yellow","darkgreen","blue", "violet", "cyan", "green", "brown")
plot(time,log[,11], xlab = "Time Elapsed", ylab = "Logical Core Utilization", main = filename, type = "l", lwd =5, ylim = c(0,100))
for( i in c(3:10)){lines(time, log[,i], col = colors[i-3], type = "l", lwd = 1 )}
legend(x="bottomright",legend = colnames(log)[3:11], col = colors, lty=1:2, cex=0.8)
}

sapply(perflog, function(x) generatePerfGraph(x))








```


```{r}
library("car")
#calculates a regression line for the data. Don't read too into this, as the R^2 coefs are likely all garbage. Except for plot three. 
regressionPlot = function(file){
log = as.data.frame(read.csv(file))
colnames(log) = c("time","memory","cpu0","cpu1","cpu2","cpu3","cpu4","cpu5","cpu6","cpu7","cpuTotal")
time = utctime(log[,1])
log[,1] = as.numeric(time)
plot = scatterplot(cpuTotal ~ time, data = log)
plot = scatterplot(memory ~ time, data = log)
plot = scatterplot(cpuTotal ~ memory, data = log)
}



sapply(perflog, function(x) regressionPlot(x))

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
