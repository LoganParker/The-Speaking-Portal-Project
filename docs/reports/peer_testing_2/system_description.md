The Speaking Portal Project is an animation-generating add-on for the Kukarella text-to-speech system. Our system is 
built as an API which is able to generate and return an MP4 animation based on the Kukarella provided text and audio 
files. For this round of peer testing, our system had its full set of features implemented. This includes generation of
videos via an API, the ability to select avatar and language(compatible with all languages available on the Kukarella 
website), as well as avatar animation specifics such as blinking and posing.
