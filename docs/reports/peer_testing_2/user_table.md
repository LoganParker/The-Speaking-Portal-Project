## Participants

A total of 9 participants completed peer evaluations for the Speaking Portal Project. Three of the evaluations were completed in remote sessions with Veronica Jack and the rest were conducted in-person. Note that all evaluations were `User Feedback` scenarios. Having no UI we thought that User Feedback Evaluations would be most appropriate for our project.
