# Data Flow Diagrams

Section 2 of the Requirements Report

An overview of your system architecture presented as a data flow diagram (DFD), at both levels 0 and level 1, along with accompanying descriptions for each diagram. You must be very specific in this DFD so to design it in a way that supports an incremental and iterative development process. You can read an intro on DFDs and adopt its notation. Remember that a process does something, so be sure to use a verb to label your processes. In describing your DFD, highlight clearly which components will be delivered for each of the following milestones: peer testing #1, peer testing #2, and the final product. You may additionally wish to include extra components and label them as bonus features that may be developed if time allows.

Diagrams will be incorporated into the PDF report.

This markdown file will be used for the diagram descriptions.
