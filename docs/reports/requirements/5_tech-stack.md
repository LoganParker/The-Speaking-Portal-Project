# Tech Stack

Due to the various approaches that could be taken for this project, our client has left us with the choice of what tech 
stack to use. Through our research, two options presented themselves: Node.js + Typescript & Python + Django. Because of
the familiarity our group already has with languages used in the existing tech stack we have chosen to use Node + 
Typescript for our backend implementation.

## Front-End
HTML & CSS
In order to maintain simplicity, any front-end development which may be required should be done in simple HTML/CSS
Styling must stay consistent with Kukarella’s - if additional frameworks such as React are required, they may be added.
Kukarella does not currently request a front-end, though did mention it may be an additional feature if time permits.
## Back-End
Node.js & Typescript
Our backend code will be built using Typescript - this provides us with strict control over types, and aligns with the 
already existing code within the Kukarella system. We will be using Node.js in order to allow us to build our service as
an easily maintainable API. The library “Rhubarb Lip Sync” is currently required for our backend implementation. This is
a command line tool controllable by various programming languages. Its last update was June 14, 2022
