In our conversations with the client, the following functional requirements were identified: 
Firstly, our users should be able to interact with the feature through a UI. Kukarella has already supplied all of the front-end UI requirements, however for testing our team will use a mock UI. This will assist with user testing and feedback while our codebase is still separate from Kukarella development. Early testing and examples from other groups proved that lip-syncing alone is not enough to produce a convincing animation—and as such facial expressions are required.  The client also noted that any voice or language selected should be able to seamlessly integrate with our animation output. This, along with user inputs and the generated audio from the Kukarella app would be required for this feature to work. Once supplied, the feature should be able to generate a downloadable MP4 on request.
