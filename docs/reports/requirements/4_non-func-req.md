## Non-Functional Requirements and Environmental Constraints.

The client stated the feature should be highly portable. This is due to Kukarella’s team wishing for a modular, easy-to-integrate approach for their codebase. As such we chose to package our feature as an API. Responsiveness was also required by the client. Our team has decided that three minutes of spoken audio should not take longer than a minute for the feature to process; although, this metric will be reassessed during the agile development phase. Lastly, our client noted that the appearance of the feature should be professional and competitive. This was later clarified to mean that our animations will need to be of high quality, with convincing lip synchronization and assets provided by professional graphic artists. It should be noted the client already has a professional artist and agreed to fund this portion of the project. Our team felt the animation should conform to the minimum 24-fps standard that the animation industry uses—as anything less could give a feeling of a stuttering or slow response.
