# List of Usability Tasks

## Users

As a user, you are a member of the general public who is using the Kukarella web application; you are someone who would
like to have a more immersive text-to-speech experience where an animated avatar reads user text aloud.

As of right now, the application can extract the timings for the mouth movements, but no animation will be produced.

Please attempt the following scenarios below in your pursuit of having an animated text-to-speech experience.

The output file will be a json file or frames **(This may change depending on our timeline)

### User Scenario 1: FileNotFound

Enter no audio or text file

### User Scenario 2: InvalidFileType

Input a non-wav file as the audio file

### User Scenario 3: CorruptedFile

Input a corrupted .wav or .txt file

## Developers

As a developer, you are a Kukarella employee who will be responsible for incorporating the API into your current system
and will be adding more customizable assets for the avatars in the future.

Since our product is not yet wrapped into an API, nor are any frames being produced, we don't have any developer scenarios yet.

Stay tuned for developer scenarios in Peer Testing II.

### Developer Scenario 1: Change the Mouth Assets

**(This might not be included depending on our progress this week)
Change out the mouth assets (files) for new ones.
