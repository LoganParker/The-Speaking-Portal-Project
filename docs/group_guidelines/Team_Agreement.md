# Team Norms/Agreement

## Introduction

The purpose of this team agreement is to develop guidelines about how we will work together to create a positive and productive process.

Team members:

- Edouard Eltherington (QA Leader)
- Logan Parker (Technical Leader/DevOps)
- Matt Kuelker (Client Liaison)
- Veronica Jack (Project/Scrum Manager)

### Communication

- Communication between team members will be through the private team Discord Server. Members will check the Discord daily. Messages can be sent at any time, but answers should not be expected for any messages outside of typical business hours (9:00 am - 5:00 pm).
- Team meetings (AKA weekly stand-ups) are scheduled every Tuesday morning from 9:30 am until 10:30 am. Team members can attend in person or through the Discord Server's Voice Channel.
- If a team member is unable to attend a meeting, they must communicate with the team and members are expected to volunteer to help rather than be asked
- Team members are asked to be mindful of others. For example:

    - no use of cell phones during the meeting
    - use the meeting time efficiently and effectively
    - give your best effort and best attitude

- Meeting minutes are to be published on GitHub within 24 hours of the end of the meeting.

    - Team meetings: Edouard will take minutes
    - Client agenda: Matt will prepare the agenda
    - Client meetings: Veronica will take minutes
    - TA and prof meetings: Logan will prepare materials to present, and all team members will support each other to ensure each member speaks at least once

### Development

- If behind schedule, remove lowest priority work items first
- If ahead of schedule, add work items from the backlog by priority
- If a team member has a suggestion for updating the Kanban board, they are expected to communicate with the team before updating it
- Team members will message the group when submitting a pull request (PR), every team member will be added as a reviewer, and all reviews require comments
- Team members will be flexible with each other while also respecting that some members are more independent when they program and others prefer working together

### Conflict

- If a conflict arises within the group, team members are expected to bring up the conflict to the team first and not to go straight to the TA or professor
- The group will work together to help resolve the conflict by first letting the individual speak without interruption to explain the issue. Team members are to listen and assist with resolving the issue (no "brushing off" an issue)
- If the issue takes longer than the time allows, an extra meeting will be scheduled to ensure the conflict is resolved in a timely manner
